## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on integrating, transforming, and visualizing online and offline sales data to uncover business insights.

### ✅ Key Steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – examined trends, outliers, and structure of both datasets.
2. **Schema Design** – created dimension and fact tables for a clean star schema.
3. **ETL Development** – unified datasets, cleaned and transformed data in Python.
4. **Power BI Dashboard** – loaded processed data and built a multi-tab dashboard.
